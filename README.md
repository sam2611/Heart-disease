The focus of this project is on predicting the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease (CHD), an important medical concern, using a machine learning algorithm. 

The project has two primary objectives: first, to conduct risk analysis based on cardiovascular data gathered from residents of Framingham, Massachusetts; and second, to predict the 10-year risk of CHD in patients. The dataset used in the project contains information for over 4,000 patients, including 15 attributes. The ultimate classification goal is to determine whether a patient is likely to develop CHD in the future.
